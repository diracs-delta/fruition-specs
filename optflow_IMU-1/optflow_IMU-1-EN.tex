\pchapter{Product Overview}

\section{General Description}

Fruition has now released a new low-cost, high-performance, low-latency planar
positioning sensor of optical flowmeter and positioning module. This module
integrates an optical flow tracking sensor, triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope
and one low-power microprocessor.

It can provide positioning information output on surfaces of various materials,
such as tiles, floors, or blankets. Its output is based on the initial
displacement calculated via an internal sensor fusion algorithm relative to
local geographic 3D coordinate bearing data, including the principal axes pitch,
roll, and yaw. The module can also output all sensors' raw data simultaneously.

\section{Applications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide orientation information for indoor service robots, such as robot vacuums.
\item Provide positioning information for portable smart toys.
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Optical tracking and positioning sensor.
\item Adaptable to almost all different indoor surface materials.
\item Adaptable to high velocities, useful in applications utilizing the module for atheltic applications.
\item Small heading sensor, based on MEMS.
\item Integrated high-precision six-axis gyroscope.
\item Stable and accurate sensor fusion algorithm used to calculate the device's displacement.
\item Able to output positioning, orientation, and other information simultaneously.
\item Extremely high stability against ambient temperature and external vibration.
\item UART interface with high baud rate and data output frequency.
\item Low host configuration requirements.
\item Low power consumption.
\end{itemize}
